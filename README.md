# Factors-Influencing-Life-Expectancy-Across-Countries

This repository presents an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding the key factors that influence life expectancy across countries and years. Using a global life expectancy dataset, the analysis combines data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical summaries, and rich visualizations to uncover meaningful health and socioeconomic patterns.

📊 Project Highlights

Comprehensive Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and filtering unrealistic values to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using groupby operations, pivot tables, and correlation analysis.

Insightful Visualizations
Includes histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and heatmaps created with Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly communicate trends and relationships.

Key Factors Analyzed

Economic indicators (GDP, GDP per capita)

Education (Schooling)

Health metrics (Adult Mortality, BMI)

Lifestyle factors (Alcohol consumption)

Immunization coverage (Polio, Diphtheria)

Country development status (Developed vs Developing)

🔍 Key Insights

Higher GDP and schooling levels are strongly associated with higher life expectancy.

Adult mortality shows a strong negative correlation with life expectancy.

Developed countries consistently outperform developing countries in life expectancy outcomes.

Improvements in healthcare access and immunization coverage play a crucial role in longevity.

Global life expectancy shows a generally increasing trend over time.
